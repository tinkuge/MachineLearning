Linear Algebra\n",":label:`sec_linear-algebra`\n","\n","Now that you can store and manipulate data,\n","let us briefly review the subset of basic linear algebra\n","that you will need to understand and implement\n","most of models covered in this book.\n","Below, we introduce the basic mathematical objects, arithmetic,\n","and operations in linear algebra,\n","expressing each of them through mathematical notation\n","and the corresponding implementation in code.\n","\n","\n","## Scalars\n","\n","If you never studied linear algebra or machine learning,\n","then your past experience with math probably consisted\n","of thinking about one number at a time.\n","And, if you ever balanced a checkbook\n","or even paid for dinner at a restaurant\n","then you already know how to do basic things\n","like adding and multiplying pairs of numbers.\n","For example, the temperature in Palo Alto is $52$ degrees Fahrenheit.\n","Formally, we call values consisting\n","of just one numerical quantity *scalars*.\n","If you wanted to convert this value to Celsius\n","(the metric system's more sensible temperature scale),\n","you would evaluate the expression $c = \\frac{5}{9}(f - 32)$, setting $f$ to $52$.\n","In this equation, each of the terms---$5$, $9$, and $32$---are scalar values.\n","The placeholders $c$ and $f$ are called *variables*\n","and they represent unknown scalar values.\n","\n","In this book, we adopt the mathematical notation\n","where scalar variables are denoted\n","by ordinary lower-cased letters (e.g., $x$, $y$, and $z$).\n","We denote the space of all (continuous) *real-valued* scalars by $\\mathbb{R}$.\n","For expedience, we will punt on rigorous definitions\n","of what precisely *space* is,\n","but just remember for now that the expression $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n","is a formal way to say that $x$ is a real-valued scalar.\n","The symbol $\\in$ can be pronounced \"in\"\n","and simply denotes membership in a set.\n","Analogously, we could write $x, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$\n","to state that $x$ and $y$ are numbers\n","whose value can only be $0$ or $1$.\n","\n","A scalar is represented by a tensor with just one element.\n","In the next snippet, we instantiate two scalars\n","and perform some familiar arithmetic operations with them,\n","namely addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"origin_pos":3,"tab":["tensorflow"],"id":"HwFBafqr-xYd","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595474147682,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1830,"user":{"displayName":"Dinakar

For now, we will skip over higher order tensors and focus on the basics.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4m_nhvp8TWBL","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595474148466,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2251,"user":{"displayName":"Dinakar Geddapu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhcRIoVExYcdvhSOVBJo3iiy9SWT0WI6bFoIcBHqA=s64","userId":"05110836538322591722"}},"outputId":"413bc160-0f3e-41e2-c8b3-8fa1bf76a0cf"},"source":["#practice\n","tf.reshape(tf.range(20), (2,5,-1))"],"execution_count":48,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 5, 2), dtype=int32, numpy=\n","array([[[ 0,  1],\n","        [ 2,  3],\n","        [ 4,  5],\n","        [ 6,  7],\n","        [ 8,  9]],\n","\n","       [[10, 11],\n","        [12, 13],\n","        [14, 15],\n","        [16, 17],\n","        [18, 19]]], dtype=int32)>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":48}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"origin_pos":39,"tab":["tensorflow"],"id":"PB5Hr0RY-xY_","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595474148467,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2242,"user":{"displayName":"Dinakar Geddapu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhcRIoVExYcdvhSOVBJo3iiy9SWT0WI6bFoIcBHqA=s64","userId":"05110836538322591722"}},"outputId":"51b457af-dac7-4a47-ba06-8f1459cacbac"},"source":["X = tf.reshape(tf.range(24), (2, 3, 4))\n","X"],"execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3, 4), dtype=int32, numpy=\n","array([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],\n","        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],\n","        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]],\n","\n","       [[12, 13, 14, 15],\n","        [16, 17, 18, 19],\n","        [20, 21, 22, 23]]], dtype=int32)>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"origin_pos":40,"id":"B7kdKL1i-xZC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Basic Properties of Tensor Arithmetic\n","\n","Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors (\"tensors\" in this subsection refer to algebraic objects)\n","of an arbitrary number of axes\n","have some nice properties that often come in handy.\n","For example, you might have noticed\n","from the definition of an elementwise operation\n","that any elementwise unary operation does not change the shape of its operand.\n","Similarly, given any two tensors with the same shape,\n","the result of any binary elementwise operation\n","will be a tensor of that same shape.\n","For example, adding two matrices of the same shape\n","performs elementwise addition over these two matrices.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"origin_pos":43,"tab":["tensorflow"],"id":"HwqFi8Au-xZD","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1595474148468,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2231,"user":{"displayName":"Dinakar Geddapu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhcRIoVExYcdvhSOVBJo3iiy9SWT0WI6bFoIcBHqA=s64","userId":"05110836538322591722"}},"outputId":"2ce87ddf-6f53-4b2e-e0f8-f3fea23f433a"},"source":["A = tf.reshape(tf.range(20, dtype=tf.float32), (5, 4))\n","B = A  # No cloning of `A` to `B` by allocating new memory\n","A, A + B"],"execution_count":50,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(<tf.Tensor: shape=(5, 4), dtype=float32, numpy=\n"," array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.],\n","        [ 4.,  5.,  6.,  7.],\n","        [ 8.,  9., 10., 11.],\n","        [12., 13., 14., 15.],\n","        [16., 17., 18., 19.]], dtype=float32)>,\n"," <tf.Tensor: shape=(5, 4), dtype=float32, numpy=\n"," array([[ 0.,  2.,  4.,  6.],\n","        [ 8., 10., 12., 14.],\n","        [16., 18., 20., 22.],\n","        [24., 26., 28., 30.],\n","        [32., 34., 36., 38.]], dtype=float32)>)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":50}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"origin_pos":44,"id":"ssTRoWLX-xZG","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Specifically, elementwise multiplication of two matrices is called their *Hadamard product* (math notation $\\odot$).\n","Consider matrix $\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ whose element of row $i$ and column $j$ is $b_{ij}$.

Linear Algebra\n","\n","In just this section,\n","we have taught you all the linear algebra\n","that you will need to understand\n","a remarkable chunk of modern deep learning.\n","There is a lot more to linear algebra\n","and a lot of that mathematics is useful for machine learning.\n","For example, matrices can be decomposed into factors,\n","and these decompositions can reveal\n","low-dimensional structure in real-world datasets.\n","There are entire subfields of machine learning\n","that focus on using matrix decompositions\n","and their generalizations to high-order tensors\n","to discover structure in datasets and solve prediction problems.\n","But this book focuses on deep learning.\n","And we believe you will be much more inclined to learn more

algebra.\n","* Vectors generalize scalars, and matrices generalize vectors.\n","* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors have zero, one, two, and an arbitrary number of axes, respectively.\n","* A tensor can be reduced along the specified axes by `sum` and `mean`.\n","* Elementwise multiplication of two matrices is called their Hadamard product. It is different from matrix multiplication.\n","* In deep learning, we often work with norms such as the $\\ell_1$ norm, the $\\ell_2$ norm, and the Frobenius norm.\n","* We can perform a variety of operations over scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors.\n","\n","## Exercises\n","\n","1.
